This tool automates the process of analyzing cryptographic ciphers using the Meet-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. It supports various block ciphers, including CRAFT, Midori64, Midori128, WARP, PRESENT80, and ARADI.

Key features:

‚úÖ Supports regular key and equivalent key attacks.

‚úÖ Generates round keys and defines bit relations for supported ciphers

‚úÖ Allows customization of attack parameters (rounds, printing options, etc.)

‚úÖ Exports results to a file for detailed analysis

‚úÖ Implements guess-and-determine (only for PRESENT80)

üìå Example Commands


Running an attack on Midori64 (Regular Key Attack)

    python3 main.py --cipher Midori64 --attack_type regular_key --rounds 5 --print_key --output midori_results.txt    
This command analyzes Midori64 using a regular key attack with 5 rounds, prints the key, and saves results in midori_results.txt.

Running an Equivalent Key Attack on CRAFT

    python3 main.py --cipher CRAFT --attack_type equivalent_key --print_block --print_block_car
Runs an equivalent key attack on CRAFT, printing the block structure and cardinality.

Running Guess-and-Determine on PRESENT80

    python3 main.py --cipher PRESENT80 --attack_type regular_key --guess_and_determine --print_bit_addr_info
Performs guess-and-determine analysis on PRESENT80, printing bit address information.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations

The guess-and-determine technique is only applicable to PRESENT80.

The cipher names are case-insensitive, but must match their official names (Midori64, not MIDORI64).

Equivalent key attacks are not supported for WARP and PRESENT80.


## How to Describe a Cipher to the Tool

To describe a cipher, you need to determine the positions of the bit addresses. As an example, consider the **regular key attack on CRAFT**:

![Diagram Description](craft_regular_key.png)

### 1. Generating Round Keys

First, the round keys must be generated based on the cipher‚Äôs key schedule. Refer to `generate_round_key.py`, where round keys are generated for other ciphers.

### 2. Describing Cipher Components in Bit-Level Representation  ddd

All cipher components‚Äîsuch as permutations and mix columns‚Äîmust be described at the **bit level**. The Sage Jupyter file `sage_support_material.ipynb` is useful for understanding and visualizing the bit-level representation of different ciphers.

For determining **bit dependencies in S-boxes**, the component functions should be computed using **SageMath**. See the Sage file `sage_support_material.ipynb` for guidance.

To describe dependencies for the S-box, two dependency lists should be written:
- **`lin_dependent_ind`** ‚Üí Stores the indices of linearly dependent bits.
- **`non_lin_dependent_ind`** ‚Üí Stores the indices of non-linearly dependent bits.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** A bit position **must not** appear in both `lin_dependent_ind` and `non_lin_dependent_ind`.  
For example, in **CRAFT**:

```python
lin_dependent_ind = [[], [], [], []]
non_lin_dependent_ind = [[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3]]


### 3. Defining the Direction Lists (directions)

The tool requires a list of operations for both forward and backward directions. This list should be structured into a directions variable containing two sub-lists: 'fwd' and 'bwd'.

Each sub-list includes a sequence of operations applied at specific bit positions, following the cipher's structure.

Structure of the directions list:

üîπ The first element of each operation list is an integer that specifies how many times the operation is repeated.
If not provided, the operation runs once by default.

üîπ Each operation consists of:

A label (name) for the operation ‚Üí Used to maintain symmetry between fwd and bwd.
The operation type (e.g., key_addition, s_box, mixing, etc.).
Lists that define dependencies ‚Üí Used to update the linearly and non-linearly dependent key sets.

üìå Naming Conventions for Operations

Forward (fwd) and Backward (bwd) operations should be symmetric.
 If an operation does not have a natural counterpart in one direction, prefix its name with '*'.
 If no action is needed, use '-' as a placeholder.
     Example: See the regular_key attack for Midori64.

### 4.  Handling Partial State Operations

Some operations affect only a portion of the cipher's state (e.g., XOR in Feistel structures). In such cases:

1) Define a pattern list containing the bit indices.
2) Use this pattern list before the operation name in directions.
